In an effor to reduce merge conflicts there are a few simple rules we should all
follow to make sure nothing goes super wrong
1. Put all work in YOUR folder, in the logical sub folder. (ie stuff thats not done does not go in finished)
2. Labels and file names should be as follows. NAME_COMPONENT_DATE.circ
3. Do not change stuff that is not in your folders. If you want to msake changes, copy the file into 
	one of your directories and then make changes.
